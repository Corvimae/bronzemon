# KAIZO BRONZEMON RULESET v1.0.1

_(it's like ironmon but less annoying)_

**Last update: April 4, 2022**

* 1\. The ROM must be randomized using the [config in this repo](https://github.com/Corvimae/bronzemon/blob/main/bronzemon-randomizer-settings.rnqs).
* 2\. Your party can only contain one Pokémon at all times, unless you need a second for forced doubles battles (Tate & Liza, etc). Whenever you catch a new Pokémon, it is your new main and you must retire your old main unless you declare the new catch as your HM friend before looking at its summary.
    * 2.1\. Only one Pokémon may be caught per route.
    * 2.2\. You can catch one additional Pokémon as an HM friend.
        * 2.2.1\. HM Friend abilities like Pickup cannot be used.
        * 2.2.2\. You can replace your HM friend if it sucks at being an HM friend. You should have universal HM learning on so this shouldn't be a problem, but sometimes you're just not vibing, y'know?
* 3\. Some moves cannot be used. If you know a banned move, you may not select it. 
   * 3.1\. Moves that heal the user cannot be used.
   * 3.2\. Moves that cause status conditions with 100% accuracy cannot be used, such as Confuse Ray and Nuzzle.
   * 3.3\. If a banned move is used due to Metronome, that does not violate this rule.
* 4\. No 600+ base stat total Pokémon unless you evolve into it.
    * 4.1\. This means your starter can be a legendary if its BST is less than 600.
* 5\. No fighting any wild Pokémon. If you gain experience due to Explosion, etc. on accident, that's fine, but try to avoid it where possible.
    * 5.1\. You can fight wilds to regain lost experience (see rule 6).
    * 5.2\. You can defeat wild Pokémon if you are trapped in the battle due to Bind, etc, with no other means of escape.
* 6\. No using healing items or PP restoring items outside of battle. 
   * 6.1\. Vitamins like PP Max, etc. are fine.
* 7\. You can only catch a Pokémon that is equal to or lower than your current Pokémon's level. 
    * 7.1\. If you catch a lower level Pokémon, you can grind back up to the highest encounter level in the area (aka if the encounter is Lv. 3-5 and you catch a Lv. 3, you can grind up to Lv. 5.)
* 8\. No Huge Power/Pure Power unless you evolve into it.
* 9\. You cannot use field Center-like healing (e.g. S.S. Anne heal).
* 10\. Once you enter a dungeon or gym, you cannot leave until you beat it or lose.
   * 10.1\. Forests, routes, and the Safari Zone are not considered dungeons.
* 11\. Held items may be used, with some restrictions.
   * 11.1\. Held items can only be used if they are picked up. Held items given consistenly from NPCs are not allowed.
   * 11.2\. Some held items are banned.
      * 11.2.1\. No Lucky Egg.
      * 11.2.2\. No Everstone.
      * 11.2.3\. No Leftovers.
      * 11.2.4\. No Soul Dew.
      * 11.2.5\. No Metronome.
* 12\. Starter must be selected at random. If the game displays all the starters like in Gen 6, you must pick whatever the cursor defaults to.
   * 12.1\. If the selected starter is banned due to its BST, the starter to its right must be selected instead.
* 13\. HM moves cannot be used in battle.
* 14\. All trainers in a gym must be defeated before fighting the leader.
* 15\. Battle type must be set to Set.
* 16\. Evolutions cannot be stopped for any reason.
* 17\. If your main is fainted, the run is over and you must restart.
* 18\. You can swap out if you get Perish Song'd, but must immediately swap back.
* 19\. No picking Berry trees.
* 20\. No Mega Evolutions.
* 21\. Some key items are banned.
   * 21.1\. No using Flutes.
   * 21.2\. No using the VS Seeker.
