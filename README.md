# KAIZO BRONZEMON RULESET v1.1.3

_(it's like ironmon but less annoying)_

**Last update: April 16, 2022**

## 1. RULESET
#### 1.01 - Ruleset Updates
This ruleset is not finalized, and may change as certain mechanics are found to be unbalanced.

* (a) Any update to the ruleset does not invalidate a completion on an older version of the ruleset.

## 2. PARTY COMPOSITION
#### 2.01 - Starter Selection
Your starter must be selected at random. 

* (a) If the game displays all the starters like in Gen 6, you must pick whatever the cursor defaults to.
* (b) If the selected starter is banned due to its BST, the starter to its right must be selected instead.

#### 2.02 - Party Limit
Your party can only contain up to two Pokémon at all times. One Pokémon is your main (see Rule 2.03) and must start in slot 1. The other Pokémon is your HM Friend (see Rule 2.04).

#### 2.03 - Main Pokémon
Whenever you catch a new Pokémon, it is your new main and you must retire your old main.

* (a) Only your main is allowed to use moves in fights on opponents.
* (b) You may have a second Pokémon as defined under Rule 2.04.

#### 2.04 - HM Friend
Before catching a Pokémon and viewing its summary, you can declare it as your HM Friend.

* (a) Your HM Friend may use HM moves outside of battle.
* (b) Your HM Friend cannot assist in double or triple battles. You can stall turns either by wasting items or by attacking your main.
* (c) You cannot stall turns on your HM Friend by using AOE moves.
* (d) The benefits of HM Friend abilities cannot be used. For example, if an HM Friend gets an item from Pickup, you must ignore it.
* (e) You can replace your HM friend if it sucks at being an HM friend. You should have universal HM learning on so this shouldn't be a problem, but sometimes you're just not vibing, y'know?

#### 2.05 - Route Catch Limit
Only one Pokémon may be caught per route.

* (a) If a wild Pokémon faints on a route due to a self-defeating move like Explosion, it counts as your route encounter and no Pokémon may be caught on this route, but you do not violate Rule 3.06.
* (b) Catching an HM Friend counts towards the catch limit for the route (see Rule 2.04).

#### 2.06 - Level Restriction
You may only catch a Pokémon that is equal to or lower than your current Pokémon's level. 

* (a) If you catch a lower level Pokémon, you can grind back up to the highest encounter level in the area (aka if the encounter table is Lv. 3-5 and you catch a Lv. 3, you can grind up to Lv. 5).
* (b) If your main dies while grinding the level difference as per Rule 2.06(a), your run is over.

#### 2.07 - Evolutions
Evolutions may not be stopped for any reason.

## 3. BANNED MECHANICS
