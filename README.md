# BRONZEMON RULESET 

_(it's like ironmon but less annoying)_

* 1\. Your party can only contain one Pokémon at all times, unless you need a second for forced doubles battles (Tate & Liza, etc). Whenever you catch a new Pokémon, it is your new main and you must retire your old main unless you declare the new catch as your HM friend before looking at its summary.
    * 1.1\. Only one Pokémon may be caught per route.
    * 1.2\. You can catch one additional Pokémon as an HM friend.
        * 1.2.1\. HM Friend abilities like Pickup cannot be used.
        * 1.2.2\. You can replace your HM friend if it sucks at being an HM friend.
* 2\. Healing moves and moves that cause status conditions with 100% accuracy cannot be used.
* 3\. No 600+ BST Pokémon unless you evolve into it.
    * 3.1\. This means your starter can be a legendary if its BST is less than 600.
* 4\. No fighting any wild Pokémon. If you gain experience due to Explosion, etc. on accident, that's fine, but try to avoid it where possible.
    * 4.1\. You can fight wilds to regain lost experience (see rule 6).
* 5\. No using healing items or PP restoring items outside of battle. Vitamins like PP Max, etc. are fine.
* 6\. You can only catch a Pokémon that is equal to or lower than your current Pokémon's level. 
    * 7.1\. If you catch a lower level Pokémon, you can grind back up to the highest encounter level in the area (aka if the encounter is Lv. 3-5 and you catch a Lv. 3, you can grind up to Lv. 5)
* 7\. No Huge Power/Pure Power unless you evolve into it.
* 8\. You can only use each field Center-like healing (e.g. S.S. Anne heal) once ever.
* 9\. Once you enter a dungeon or gym, you cannot leave until you beat it or lose.
* 10\. Held items may be used, with some restrictions.
   * 10.1\. Held items can only be used if they are picked up. Held items given consistenly from NPCs are not allowed.
   * 10.2\. Some held items are banned.
      * 10.2.1\. No Lucky Egg.
      * 10.2.2\. No Everstone.
      * 10.2.3\. No Leftovers.
      * 10.2.4\. No Soul Dew.
      * 10.2.5\. No Metronome.
* 11\. Starter must be selected at random. If the game displays all the starters like in Gen 6, you must pick whatever the cursor defaults to.
* 12\. HM moves cannot be used in battle.
* 13\. All trainers in a gym must be defeated before fighting the leader.
