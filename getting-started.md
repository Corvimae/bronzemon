# Getting Started with Ironmon+

## 1. Get a ROM
Ironmon+ and its variants are designed to work with any Pokémon game release in Gen 3 or later. You need a ROM of that game in order to randomize it.

The laws in your country may differ, but in the United States, you are legally allowed to possess a ROM if you own a physical copy of a game. Distribution of ROMs is illegal, however, and thus I cannot help you get a ROM. There are various methods to dump ROMs of your games using a 3DS using custom firmware; whatever you decide to do, you'll need to get ahold of this first.

## 2. Set Up Universal Pokémon Randomizer ZX
You can use any Pokémon randomizer to play Ironmon+, but I recommend using [Universal Pokémon Randomizer ZX](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) (hereafter abbreviated to UPR-ZX, as it's a very long title). Once you've downloaded and unzipped the latest release, grab the randomizer settings file for the variant you want to play (such as the [Kaizo Ironmon+ settings here](/randomizer-settings/kaizo-ironmon-plus-randomizer-settings.rnqs)).

Launch UPR-ZX and click `Open ROM`. Select your ROM, then wait for the randomizer to load. Click `Load Settings` and choose the randomizer settings file you downloaded. Click `Randomize (Save)`, choose where you want to save the randomized ROM, then wait for the randomizer to work its magic.

## 3. Launch the Game!
Launch your emulator of choice (see a list of recommended emulators [here]) and open the **randomized ROM** (the one you saved in step 2, NOT the ROM you downloaded in step 1). 

Once the game starts up, open the in-game options and set Battle Style to Set.

Progress through the story until you reach the point where you're given your starter Pokémon, then **save the game** before triggering that cutscene.

If everything worked properly, the three starter choices should be randomized!

## Gameplay Recommendations
I recommend doing the following before starting your Ironmon+ adventure:
- Keep track of your attempts! Start a counter at 0 somewhere, even if it's just a text file, and increase it by 1 every time you reset.
- Set a hotkey to speed up emulation speed. The early game of Ironmon+ can get frustrating, especially for games with longer intro sequences like Black/White 2.
- Set a hotkey to mash the A button to avoid wrist strain from mashing through text.
- Name your Pokémon every time! You'll grow more attached to them :>
