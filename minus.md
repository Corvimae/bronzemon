**Last updated: June 13, 2022**

[Randomizer Settings](/randomizer-settings/kaizo-ironmon-minus-randomizer-settings.rnqs)

## 1. RULESET
#### 1.01 - Base Ruleset
All rules from the [Kaizo Ironmon+ ruleset](/rules.md) apply unless otherwise specified in this document.

* (a) If a rule in the Ironmon- ruleset contradicts the Kaizo ruleset, the Ironmon- ruleset takes precedent.

## 2. RULE CHANGES
#### 2.01 - Base Stat Total Limit
Your main Pokémon, as defined in [2.03 (Main Pokémon)](/rules.md#203---main-pokémon), cannot have a base stat total above 450.

* (a) If none of the available starters have a valid base stat total, you must pick the option with the lowest base stat total. After fighting your rival, you must catch a valid main before fighting another trainer. If still
no valid options are availble, fight as few trainers as possible to reach the next set of encounters, then try again,
and repeat until you catch a valid main.

#### 2.02 - Potion Allotment
Once per Pokémart, you may purchase either 2 Potions, 1 Super Potion, or 1 Hyper Potion.

* (a) You cannot purchase items if they're not available yet, of course.

#### 2.03 - Second Chance
You may revive your main Pokémon once.

* (a) The second time your main Pokémon faints, your run is over.
* (b) You may not use your HM friend to finish the battle; you must either revive your main or lose the fight and return to the center.
* (c) Dying in this way does not violate Kaizo rule [4.02 (Dungeon Completion)](/rules.md#402---completion), but you must immediately return to the dungeon and finish it.

#### 2.04 - Evolutions
Evolutions must always be stopped.

* (a) This rule overrides Kaizo rule [2.07 (Evolutions)](/rules.md#207---evolutions).
* (b) Item evolutions are allowed, but if the evolution violates Ironmon- rule [2.01 (Base Stat Total)](#2.01---base-stat-total-limit), you must immediately pivot to a new main.

#### 2.05 - Held Items
The held item Everstone is unbanned for convenience.

* (a) This rule overrides Kaizo rule [3.04(d) (Banned Held Items - Everstone)](/rules.md#304---banned-held-items).

## 3. RANDOMIZATION CHANGES
#### 3.01 - Experience Curve Standardization
Experience curves must be standardized to Medium-Slow.

* (a) This rule overrides Kaizo rule [6.03 (Experience Curve Standardization)](/rules.md#603---experience-curve-standarization).
