## Kaizo Ironmon- Ruleset v1.0.0

**Last updated: June 13, 2022**

## 1. RULESET
#### 1.01 - Base Ruleset
All rules from the [Kaizo Ironmon+ ruleset](/rules.md) apply unless otherwise specified in this document.

* (a) If a rule in the Ironmon- ruleset contradicts the Kaizo ruleset, the Ironmon- ruleset takes precedent.

## 2. RULE CHANGES
#### 2.01 - Base Stat Total Limit
Your main Pokémon, as defined in [2.03 (Main Pokémon)](/rules.md#203---main-pokémon), cannot have a base stat total above 450.

#### 2.02 - Potion Allotment
The first time you enter a town with a Pokémart, you may immediately run to the mart and purchase 2 of any available potion.

* (a) If you forget to do this, you may purchase them before you leave; the purpose of going to the mart
immediately is to help prevent double-purchasing.

#### 2.03 - Second Chance
You may revive your main Pokémon once.

* (a) The second time your main Pokémon faints, your run is over.
* (b) You may not use your HM friend to finish the battle; you must either revive your main or lose the fight and return to the center.
* (c) Dying in this way does not violate Kaizo rule [4.02 (Dungeon Completion)](/rules.md#402---completion), but you must immediately return to the dungeon and finish it.

#### 2.04 - Evolutions
Evolutions must always be stopped.

* (a) This rule overrides Kaizo rule [2.07](/rules.md#207---evolutions).
* (b) Item evolutions are allowed, but if the evolution violates Ironmon- rule [2.01 (Base Stat Total)](#2.01---base-stat-total-limit), you must immediately pivot to a new main.

## 3. RANDOMIZATION CHANGES
#### 3.01 - Experience Curve Standardization
Experience curves must be standardized to Medium-Slow.

* (a) This rule overrides Kaizo rule [6.03 (Experience Curve Standardization)](/rules.md#603---experience-curve-standarization).
