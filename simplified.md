# Kaizo Ironmon+ Simplified Ruleset v1.1.6

This is a simplified version of the Kaizo Ironmon+ ruleset. These rules may not
be fully up-to-date, and so you should always defer to the [full ruleset](/rules.md)
if there is a contradiction.

### Like No One Ever Was
Base stats, abilities, moves, evolutions, TMs, items, and more are all randomized. Every Trainer has a brand new team, and boss trainers (like gym leaders) have larger teams than normal.

### One Pokémon, One Shot
You may only use one Pokémon in fights. When you catch a new Pokémon, you must switch to using it immediately. If that Pokémon dies, the run is over.

> You can have additional Pokémon for HM usage, but you cannot use them in fights.

### One Catch, No Upgrades
You can only catch one Pokémon on each route. That Pokémon must be your current main's level or lower.

### Stay Out of Ubers
Your main cannot have a base stat total of 600 of above.

### Speedrun Strats
No grinding experience on wild Pokémon.

### Don't Break the Game
Certain abilities, held items, and key items are banned.

### Heal In the Moment
You cannot restore HP, PP, or remove status conditions outside of battle.

### One-geons
Once you enter a dungeon (like team hideouts or the Silph Co.), you cannot leave until you complete it.

### Gym Trainer Meet-and-Greet
You must defeat all gym trainers before fighting the leader.

## Ironmon+ Touring Ruleset v1.0.0

This is an extension of the Kaizo Ironmon+ rules above designed for a different, endurance-style challenge. All the Kaizo Ironmon+ rules apply, plus:

### No Time to Queue
You may only use each Pokémon center to heal one time.

### Univeral Basic Potion Income
When you arrive at a town with a Pokémart for the first time, you may buy 5 Potions.

### Don't Push Yourself Too Hard
In the Elite Four, you may only increase combat stages to +3 with non-damaging moves.

### Heal Out of the Moment
You can restore HP and status conditions outside of battle (unlike the base rules).

## Kaizo Ironmon- Ruleset v1.0.0

This is an extension of the Kaizo Ironmon+ rules above designed to let weaker Pokémon have their chance at glory. All the Kaizo Ironmon+ rules apply, plus:

### Keep 'em Smol
The base stat total maxium is reduced to 450.

### Buy Yourself Something Nice
When you arrive at a town with a Pokémart for the first time, you may buy 2 of any available potion.

### You Only Live Twice
The first time you faint, you may revive and continue the run. The second time you faint, the run is over.

### Seriously, Keep 'em Smol
You must always stop evolutions. You may use evolution items, but if the Pokémon becomes too strong, you cannot use it.
