## Kaizo Ironmon+ Simplified Ruleset v1.1.6

This is a simplified version of the Kaizo Ironmon+ ruleset. These rules may not
be fully up-to-date, and so you should always defer to the [full ruleset](/rules.md)
if there is a contradiction.

## Like No One Ever Was
Base stats, abilities, moves, evolutions, TMs, items, and more are all randomized. Every Trainer has a brand new team, and boss trainers (like gym leaders) have larger teams than normal.

## One Pokémon, One Shot
You may only use one Pokémon in fights. When you catch a new Pokémon, you must switch to using it immediately. If that Pokémon dies, the run is over.

> You can have additional Pokémon for HM usage, but you cannot use them in fights.

## One Catch, No Upgrades
You can only catch one Pokémon on each route. That Pokémon must be your current main's level or lower.

## Stay Out of Ubers
Your main cannot have a base stat total of 600 of above.

## Speedrun Strats
No grinding experience on wild Pokémon.

## Don't Break the Game
Certain abilities, held items, and key items are banned.

## Heal In the Moment
You cannot restore HP, health, or remove status conditions outside of battle.

## One-geons
Once you enter a dungeon (like team hideouts or the Silph Co.), you cannot leave until you complete it.

## Gym Trainer Meet-and-Greet
You must defeat all gym trainers before fighting the leader.
